# This Flask app contains two routes that can be used independently to display scraped data from a database and to scrape new data as needed.
# The root route displays the current contents of a Mongo database while the scrape route activates a script that scrapes the latest Mars mission
# images and facts from various websites and updates the Mongo database. 

# Import dependencies.
from flask import Flask, render_template
import pymongo

# Set up Flask app to run from command line.

# Set up Mongo connection.
conn = "mongodb://localhost:27017"
client = pymongo.MongoClient(conn)

# Connect to Mongo database and collection.
db = client.mars_db
collection = db.mars_collection

# Root route queries Mongo database containing scraped content and passes results through a Flask html template before displaying them.
@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Query collection and store results in variable.
    items = list(collection.find())

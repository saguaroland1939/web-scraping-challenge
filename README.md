# Mission to Mars Web-scraping Challenge
# Overview
### This project utilizes web-scraping, noSQL, and app tools to create a webpage that displays the latest information about the Mars mission.
# Tools used
### Splinter reads in dynamically-rendered html from four websites and automates the clicking of buttons to navigate websites during scraping.
### Beautiful Soup extracts content from each html file.
### Pandas is used to read in tabular content from one of the websites and clean it.
### Content is stored in a Mongo database, accessed with Pymongo. 
### A Flask app is used to present the data on a webpage styled with a Flask template.
# Files
### app.py is a Flask app that contains two routes that can be used independently to 1) Display The current contents of a Mongo database and 2) To scrape new data as ### needed.The scraping functionality can take several minutes to complete and is therefore separated from the root route to ensure that at least an initial home page ### loads quickly. The root route displays the current contents of a Mongo database using a Flask template (index.html) for styling. The scrape route activates a script (scrape_mars.py) that scrapes the latest Mars mission images and facts from various websites and returns a dictionary full of content. app.py uses Pymongo to connec to a Mongo database and save the new content.

### scrape_mars.py is a python script that uses Splinter and Beautiful soup to scrape four different websites and compile the scraped content into a single dictionary which is passed to app.py.
### index.html is a Flask HTML template that works with a Flask app called app.py. It receives a dictionary called latest_content from the Flask app, extracts content from the dictionary, and displays it. A Bootstrap grid is used for placement and a Bootstrap button navigates to the /scrape route in app.py to scrape new content.

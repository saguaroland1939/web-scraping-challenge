# Mission to Mars Web-scraping Challenge
#
### This project utilizes a combination of web-scraping, database, and web-design tools to create a dynamic
### web-scraping tool to display the latest information about Mars missions.
###
### Beautiful Soup and html.parser read in the html from each website. Splinter is used for dynamically-rendered 
### pages and to automate navigation between pages. Scraped content is cleaned and organized using PyMongo and 
### Pandas and stored in a MongoDB database. Finally, content is diplayed dynamically to a new page using Flask Templating.
